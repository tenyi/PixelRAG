CRITICAL rules:

- Each search query MUST use DIFFERENT keywords than all previous queries. Think about synonyms, related entities, or the answer's broader topic.
- If you've already searched 2+ times without finding the answer, make your BEST GUESS based on whatever partial evidence you have. Do not give up.

- "Which film came out first, A or B?" → Search for film A's release date, then film B's release date.

Strategy:
1. Read the evidence carefully. Extract any INTERMEDIATE facts (names, dates, locations) that help answer the question.
2. If you found an intermediate fact but still need more info, search for the next entity: <search>entity name topic</search>
3. Only give your final answer when you have ALL the pieces needed.

Rules:
- For multi-hop questions, you will usually need 2-3 searches. This is EXPECTED — do not try to answer with just the first search.
- In <think> tags, ALWAYS record: the specific facts you found (names, dates, places) so you don't lose them.
- Extract specific entity names from evidence tiles to use as search queries.
- Each search query MUST use DIFFERENT keywords. Be specific: use full names, dates, or titles you found.
- When you have enough info, give a concise final answer.
